Analysis of effectiveness of Run-length Encoding Technique, Haar-Wavelet Transform Technique and Huffman Encoding Technique for image(data) compression algorithm.


Image compression plays an impassive role in memory storage while getting a good
quality compressed image. There are two types of compression such as Lossy and
Lossless compression. Huffman coding is one of the efficient lossless compression
techniques. It is a process for getting exact restoration of original data after
decompression. It has a lower Compression ratio. Lossy compression is a process for
getting not exact restoration of Original data after decompression. However, the
accuracy of the reconstruction is traded with the efficiency of compression. It is mainly
used for image data compression and decompression. It has a higher compression
ratio. Lossy compression can be seen in fast transmission of still images over the
internet where the amount of error can be acceptable. Enhancement techniques mainly
fall into two broad categories: spatial domain methods and frequency domain methods.
Spatial domain techniques are more popular than the frequency domain methods
because they are based on direct manipulation of pixels in an image such as logarithmic
transforms, power-law transforms, and histogram equalization. However, these pixel
values are manipulated to achieve the desired enhancement. But they usually enhance
the whole image in a uniform manner which in many cases produces undesirable
results.
